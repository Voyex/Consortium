{"name":"Chris Renaud","about":"Ethan Christer Renaud hails from the small town of Tomah, Wisconsin, born into a musically passionate and inclined family, and has been heavily involved in all things music since he could first remember. Joining band in the sixth grade was his first step into the world of performing arts, and lead up to eventually joining choir. After auditioning for Eau Claire's percussion studio and being rejected, Chris found himself at a loss in the realm of collegiate music until he was accepted into the composition studio and later the symphonic and TTBB choirs at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. \r\nFrom singing, to percussion, and now to piano and composition, Chris studies at the university in his third year, and is pursuing a certificate in the recording arts as well. He hopes to eventually work in a professional studio and produce music, improve his theory and composition skills in the meantime, and eventually make it into graduate school to complete a master's, and possibly doctorate degree in music composition. \r\nOutside of his interest in composing primarily in a minimalistic style for chamber ensembles, solo piano, chorus, and soon expanding his horizons into orchestration and electronic music, Chris enjoys spending time with his friends and chosen family, listening to music, playing video games, and occasionally cuddles with his cat, Judge.","works":""}
