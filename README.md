# Consortium
Project for a web systems class.

This project requires an SQL database named 'users' to funtion.
'users' has an 'id' field which is an auto-incremented INT and is the primary key, a 'password' field which is a not null LONGTEXT, and an 'email' field which is a non null varchar of length 100.
